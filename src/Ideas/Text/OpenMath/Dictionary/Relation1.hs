{-| This symbol represents the binary inequality function. -}
neqSymbol :: Symbol
neqSymbol = makeSymbol "relation1" "neq"

returns true if the first argument is less than or equal to the second, it
returns false otherwise. -}

{-| This symbol is used to denote the approximate equality of its two
arguments. -}
