{-| This symbol represents an n-ary function used to construct (or describe)
vectors. Vectors in this CD are considered to be row vectors and must
therefore be transposed to be considered as column vectors. -}
vectorSymbol :: Symbol
vectorSymbol = makeSymbol "linalg2" "vector"

{-| This symbol is an n-ary constructor used to represent rows of matrices.
Its arguments should be members of a ring. -}
matrixrowSymbol :: Symbol
matrixrowSymbol = makeSymbol "linalg2" "matrixrow"

{-| This symbol is an n-ary matrix constructor which requires matrixrow's as
arguments. It is used to represent matrices. -}
